# mLearning_2D
This is an ongoing project to create a machine learning model for data in the form of 2D arrays. The modules in
this repo reflect my current progress. For a more up-to-date (but less stable) version, see other branches.

# To run in a Docker container:
  $ docker build -t waleedka/modern-deep-learning .
  
  $ docker run -i -t --name mlearn -v /[absolute path to]/mLearning/:/app waleedka/modern-deep-learning:latest
  
# TO DO
